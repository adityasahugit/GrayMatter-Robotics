    "\n",
    "You are given a list of destinations in Los Angeles along with their latitude and longitude (in degrees). Your goal is to visit all the destinations and return to your starting location efficiently (as defined by an objective function that we will specify and you will implement). The first location in the list read in from the text file is LAX, which will be your starting and finishing location.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recognize this problem setup as the Traveling Salesman Problem which is NP-Hard. You may be able to design an algorithm (i.e. brute force) for the list of locations we give you that computes the globally optimal solution and that has a tractible runtime. However, that algorithm won't scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because we can't find optimal solutions to problems like this doesn't mean we can disregard them. Real-world problems frequently map to setups like TSP, so different algorithmic strategies to tackle them have emerged, including genetic algorithms (also approximation algorithms, annealing, etc...)\n",

    "## Genetic Algorithms Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic Algorithms are a method for solving optimization problems based on natural selection. It tracks pretty closely to the tenets of Darwinism. In Darwinism, given some variation in genetic traits for some population, the members of that species with desirable genetic traits will survive more often and reproduce more, passing those genetics down, and thus, over generations, the desirable genetics will have larger market share.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic setup of a genetic algorithm is largely the same. Given some NP-hard problem, we don't assume to have any intuition about the \"desirable traits\" of a potential solution, so we generate some initial set of candidate solutions randomly. These solutions are a set of valid paths that begin at LAX, visit every node, and don't visit any node more than once*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This set of candidate solutions is called the **population**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each solution in the population is a **member**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of members in a population is the **population size**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms undergo some specified number of iterations. Each iteration works with its own population (each with the same number of members). In the initial iteration, the members of a population are generated randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've generated your initial population, you need to evaluate the quality of each member (i.e. each candidate solution). This metric is called a member's **fitness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more fit a member of a population is, the more likely it is to have substructure (i.e. genetic traits) that would improve other solutions (i.e. there may be a 4 node subsequence of that path that is very efficient even if it's a completely random shuffle).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the quality of each solution allows us to refine our strategy for generating new solutions. While the initial population was randomly generated, each member in a subsequent population is assembled as a composite of two members of the preceeding generation. Instead of choosing those two parents randomly, we can incorporate our grading of the current members fitnesses into the selection process and thus pass on preferable \"genes\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms have heuristics for spawning the next generation's population from the current population:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each member of the new generation is the offspring of two member's of the current population. \n",
    "2. More fit members of the current generation are more likely to be selected as parents for the new generation's population members\n",
    "3. After both parents complete encoding a child, that child's genes (i.e. the new solution) may mutate. Mutation is a random event that modifies the child's genes (\"solution\"). In our case, mutation will simply be swapping the positions of two nodes in the child's path (i.e the child's solution) (the indices of those nodes will also be random).\n",
    "4. When creating a child, each parent will pass on at least 1 element (\"gene\") of its solution, but there is no guarantee about the relative concentration of one parent's \"genes\" vs the other parent's \"genes\" in the offspring.**\n",
    "5. Once both are selected, the relative fitness of one parent compared to the other has no weight in determining their share of the child's \"genes\"**\n",
    "6. The order in which parents insert their \"genes\" into the child is random and also agnostic to their relative fitness**\n",
    "\n",
    "The important concepts to understand are the first 3 items of that list. The exact mechanism through which two parents' solutions merge into a child's solution (1) will be explained when you go to implement it (our method isn't that complicated).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutation is a useful tactic both in evolution and in genetic algorithms. In evolution, mutation helps promote genetic diversity (i.e. so everyone doesn't converge to the same genetic makeup) and can introduce new traits that may be beneficial. In genetic algorithms, it serves an analogous purpose. Over generations, populations can start to converge, where members of a population can become similar and in turn produce a population of increasingly similar offspring in the next generation. If there's no countermeasure for this, your algorithm may converge to a local maxima before exploring much of the state space. Not only can mutation help prevent this, but the initial population that was randomly generated may be concentrated in a small portion of the state space. Injecting noise when creating subsequent populations can be beneficial in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* The last leg of any path is returning back to LAX but that isn't factored in until later (it'll make sense when you get to that point in the assignment). \n",
    "\n",
    "\\** The last 3 points are implementation details more than conceptually important. It will make more sense once you get there"

    "1. Create a list with size n = # of population members and assign each element in the list to 1.0/n, giving a uniform distribution\n",

The first element corresponds to the first population member, not the member with the best fitness score (unless that is the first population member)\n",
